# Notebooks

Welcome to the PipeMario notebooks collection. Here you'll find Jupyter notebooks documenting various experiments and workflows.

## Available Notebooks

All notebooks are automatically synced from the `notebooks/` directory. When you push a new `.ipynb` file, it will automatically appear here.

## How to Contribute

1. Create your Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory
2. Name it with a descriptive prefix (e.g., `01_feature_name.ipynb`)
3. Push to the main branch
4. The notebook will automatically be converted to MDX and appear in this section

## Browse Notebooks

Check the "Notebooks" section in the navigation to see all available notebooks.
